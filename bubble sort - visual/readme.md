* **Disclaimer**. Did not try to use any separation of concerns and other stuff. I just wanted this thing to be working and that's it.
* This thing was made with the help of the **Processing** library. *I wanted to use this thing for a long long time. Shoutout to the Coding Train*
* I made this sort visualization because I was bored and I was curious how a sort would actually look. Because I discovered kotlin and that I could use the core library and not the Processing IDE, I just went for it.
* Better read the **Lines** in main.kt class for a better description of what things do.
* To get access to Processing, go to [this (https://processing.org/download/) page and after downloading the zip, put the core/library into your projects external library.
