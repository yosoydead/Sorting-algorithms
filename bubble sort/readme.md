Bubble sort is a simple algorithms that works in O(n^2) time. It consists of n rounds, and on each round, it iterates through the elements of the array. Whenever two consecutive elements are found that are in wrong order, the algorithms swaps them.
This is an example of a sorting algorithm that always swaps consecutive elements in the array.
In the case of nearly sorted data, bubble sort takes O(n) time, but requires at least 2 passes through the data (whereas insertion sort requires something more like 1 pass).
