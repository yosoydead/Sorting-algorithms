* **Disclaimer**. Did not try to use any separation of concerns and other stuff. I just wanted this thing to be working and that's it.
* This thing was made with the help of the **Processing** library. *I wanted to use this thing for a long long time. Shoutout to the Coding Train*
* This follows the same thought process as the bubble sort - visual file.
* To get access to Processing, go to [this (https://processing.org/download/) page and after downloading the zip, put the core/library into your projects external library.
