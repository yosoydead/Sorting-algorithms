* In this repo I will store some sorting algorithms.

* **Disclaimer!** The visualization of the sort algorithms was done using the **Processing library** which was intended to work for *java*. Some of the files may not be commeted yet. I'll add extensive descriptions for each visual sort later.

Sorts:
1. 1) [x] Bubble Sort
		* [X] Visual
2. 2) [x] Insertion Sort
3. 3) [x] Selection Sort
		* [X] Visual
4. 4) [ ] Shell Sort
5. 5) [x] Merge Sort
6. 6) [ ] Heap Sort
7. 7) [x] Quick Sort
8. 8) [x] Radix Sort
